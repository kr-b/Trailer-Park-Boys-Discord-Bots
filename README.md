# Trailer Park Boys - Discord Bots
Invite the Trailer Park Boys to your Discord server with these bots.
Whenever you mention one of the bots, they say a random quote from their character.
Some also have a chance of mentioning another bot which can start an arguement..

## Get started
You will need to create the Discord bots through https://discord.com/developers/applications and then set up their names and icons as you wish. Then copy the API tokens into a file `.env` in the same path as the Python scripts.

You can then run the bash script to run all the bots in the background.
```
$ ./run_all.sh
```
